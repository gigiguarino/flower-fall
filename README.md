# flower-fall

This is the first video game I've created. <br>
I used Unity to develop this. <br>
Coding language is C#. I also make use of Unity's scripting API. <br>
The graphics are mine as well - created in Pixen (a Mac application). <br>

Controls: <br>
Arrow keys for movement.

Rules: <br>
Dodge the skulls and collect the flowers.<br>
Skulls take away health, and flowers increase your score. 

Files: <br>
playerScript.cs - Controls player movement, point collection, health loss and regeneration of objects. <br>
boundsScript.cs - Deletes falling objects that fall out of bounds.
